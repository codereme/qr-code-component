            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
            joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have
            heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
            incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of
            my life. Since completing
            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting
            guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.

            attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”

            Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

          <blockquote class="testimonial--quoted">
            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
            enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
            curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
            assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in
            a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example
            of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
            multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
