# QR Code Component

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Getting Started

The challenge was to build out this QR code component and get it as close as possible to the original design.

To accomplished this, I used:

- Semantic HTML5 for the structure
- CSS for the styling
- Flexbox
- Logical Properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design principles

### Building the Foundation

To keep it simple and accessible I went with semantic HTML5:

- Used an `<article>` as our main card component

### Styling and Layout Approach

For maintainable styles and responsive layout, I implemented:

- A design system based on the `Figma design` and style guide, using `CSS custom properties` for colors, font styles and elements spacing
- Wrapped everything in a `.container` div to center the component with `Flexbox`
- `Mobile-first` workflow

### The Invisible Essentials

Beyond the visual design, I also focused on `accessibility` and `SEO fundamentals`:

- ARIA label for enhanced context
- Seo-friendly meta tags and descriptions
