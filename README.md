## Getting Started

The challenge was to build out this QR code component and get it as close as possible to the original design.

To accomplished this, I used:

- Semantic HTML5 for the structure
- CSS for the styling
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design principles

### Building the Foundation

To keep it simple and accessible I went with semantic HTML5:

- Used an `<article>` as our main card component

### Styling and Layout Approach

For maintainable styles and responsive layout, I implemented:

- A design system based on the Figma design and style guide, using CSS custom properties for colors, font styles and elements spacing
- Wrapped everything in a `.container` div to center the component with Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### The Invisible Essentials

Beyond the visual design, I also focused on accessibility and SEO fundamentals

- ARIA label for enhanced context
- Seo-friendly meta tags and descriptions
